# Building a Movie Recommender System with Machine Learning Case-Study
Please be advised that, in compliance with project confidentiality requirements, I am unable to disclose the code used in this project publicly. However, I am more than willing to discuss the project's methodology, outcomes, and provide general insights without revealing specific code details.

# Context
This project aims to construct a recommendation algorithm using content or collaborative filtering techniques to accurately predict how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed, based on their past preferences.

# Dataset
This dataset consists of several million 5-star ratings obtained from users of the online MovieLens movie recommendation service. The MovieLens dataset has long been used by industry and academic researchers to improve the performance of explicitly-based recommender systems.
  
# Expected Outcomes
- Analyze Patterns in Movie Consumption
- Develop a Movie Recommendation Engine
- Construct an Application Incorporating the Movie Recommendation System (App)
- Present Discoveries to Stakeholder Audience
  
# Tools Used
- Python
  - Streamlit
  - scikit-learn
  - nltk
- Comet
- GitHub
- AWS EC2 with S3 bucket
