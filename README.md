# Building a Movie Recommender System with Machine Learning Case Study
Please be advised that, in compliance with project confidentiality requirements, I am unable to disclose the code used in this project publicly. However, I am more than willing to discuss the project's methodology, outcomes, and provide general insights without revealing specific code details.

# Context
This project aims to construct a recommendation algorithm using content or collaborative filtering techniques to accurately predict how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed, based on their past preferences.

# Dataset
This dataset consists of several million 5-star ratings obtained from users of the online MovieLens movie recommendation service. The MovieLens dataset has long been used by industry and academic researchers to improve the performance of explicitly-based recommender systems.
  
# Expected Outcomes
- Analyze Patterns in Movie Consumption
- Develop a Movie Recommendation Engine
- Construct an Application Incorporating the Movie Recommendation System (App)
- Present Discoveries to Stakeholder Audience
  
# Tools Used
- Python
  - Streamlit
  - scikit-learn
  - nltk
- Comet
- GitHub
- AWS EC2 with S3 bucket

# Output

- The genre drama has the highest number of movies compared to other genres, indicating its popularity in the film industry.
- Drama films often explore relatable human emotions and experiences, making them appealing to a broad audience.
- The genre may be considered cost-effective to produce compared to genres that demand extensive special effects or large-scale action sequences.
- The genre comedy is the second one that has most movies.Comedy films often revolve around everyday life, social situations, and humorous observations that audiences can relate to.

- The peaks indicate months with higher movie ratings, while troughs represent months with relatively lower ratings. 
- By analyzing the graph, it is possible to identify specific months or periods with higher movie ratings.

- The graph on the left has a dataset that exhibits a left-skewed distribution of ratings, indicating that more users tend to give positive ratings to movies
- A smaller proportion of users gave ratings between 0 and 2.7, while a larger proportion provided ratings between 3 and 5, indicating a preference for positively rated movies
- The dataset shows a notable split in ratings around the value of 2.6, with a large number of users giving ratings of 2.6 and above, and a smaller number of users rating movies below 2.6
- The pie chart shows the total number of people who rated movies above 2.6: 32096073.5 which is 90.9%
- The total number of people who rated movies 2.6 and below: 3202569.5 which is 9.1%

# Conclusions
- The genre drama has the highest number of movies compared to other genres, indicating its popularity in the film industry.
- This suggests that there is a significant audience demand for this genre. Drama films often explore relatable human emotions and experiences, making them appealing to a broad audience.
- The genre may be considered cost-effective to produce compared to genres that demand extensive special effects or large-scale action sequences.
  
# Recommendations
- Recognize that Unfavorable Movie Experiences Are Also Valuable: Consider Incorporating Watch Time Metrics to Identify Movies Users May Not Have Enjoyed. This data is crucial in understanding individual preferences.
- Motivate Users to Provide Movie Ratings, Especially for Less-Rated Films and Infrequent Raters. This effort aims to balance our dataset effectively.
